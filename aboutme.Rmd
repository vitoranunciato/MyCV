# About me

I am a Ph.D. student in Crop Protection (Weed Science), expected to graduate by March of 2021. My research scope includes tank‑mix interactions, resistant weed management, and data analysis. I have been advised by Dr. Caio A. Carbonari and Co‑advisor by Dr. Greg R. Kruger. The title of my thesis for my Master’s degree is The Effect of glyphosate on the growth and reproduction of Digitaria insularis. My  ungraduate focus was in agronomy and I was advised by Dr. Dionísio L. P. Gazziero, in the following lines of research: resistance of weeds to herbicides and   weed management in soybeans. I also had experience with Junior Enterprise and Research as an intern, where I found my passion for agronomic research. Since then, I feel very keen to pursue a career in research, science, and industry, dedicating my entire academic life to contribute to those subjects.
